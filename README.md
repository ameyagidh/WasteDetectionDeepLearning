# Waste Detection Deep Learning

## Overview

The "Waste Detection Deep Learning" project is designed to leverage deep learning techniques for waste detection. The project consists of several components and workflows to facilitate the detection and classification of waste in images.

## Components

### 1. Workflows

The workflows in this project represent the end-to-end processes involved in waste detection. They orchestrate the execution of various tasks and ensure a smooth flow of data and information.

### 2. Constants

This module includes constants and configuration settings used across the project. Centralizing constants makes it easier to manage and update configurations.

### 3. Entity

The Entity module encapsulates data structures and objects used in the waste detection process. It defines the entities and their relationships within the system.

### 4. Components

Components are reusable building blocks that perform specific functions in the waste detection pipeline. These can include image preprocessing, feature extraction, and other tasks crucial to the detection process.

### 5. Pipelines

Pipelines represent the end-to-end flow of waste detection tasks. They connect different components and workflows to create a seamless process from input to output.

### 6. App.py

The `App.py` file serves as the entry point for the application. It orchestrates the execution of workflows and ensures the proper functioning of the waste detection system.
